## Data Analytics Practice

## NYC Taxi Data Analysis with SQL (BigQuery and Colab)

This is my SQL training repository!  
This project explores the [NYC Yellow Taxi Trips 2022 dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-data/new_york_taxi_trips) using **SQL** queries on **Google Colab**.  
The goal is to gain insights from real-world transportation data while strengthening my SQL skills.
